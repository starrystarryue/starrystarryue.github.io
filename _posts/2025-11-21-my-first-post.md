## This is Starryue's first post! 

Sooooo many to say, but for the first post, let's just keep it brief and start with a little about ***myself*** !

#### More about me ！😄

Besides what is mentioned in my front page, I am also glad to tell you that:

1. Peking University is **a really really good place** where you get meet many interesting brains.
2. I'm a member of *FL Hiphop Crew*, currently polishing choreograohy. If you're around next semester during our flash performance, come find me!
3. On top of that, I absolutely love *figure* *skating*, something I've been practicing for **6 years** since I was 6. ❄️⛸️
4. I'm a playful soul—not only am I a beginner in some things, but I also enjoy all kinds of games.
5. currently reading: *Brave New World*
6. favorite food? ​M​A​TC​H​A​!​!:tea:
7. MBTI? ENFJ (honestly I lean more toward REST—just a personal preference!😎)
8. I wrote these words in a rush—deadlines and quizzes ~~(yes it's you, vcl)~~ are chasing after me.
9. Last but definitely not least, I’m really **glad to meet you, my friend**! Let’s enjoy the journey ahead! 🌟
